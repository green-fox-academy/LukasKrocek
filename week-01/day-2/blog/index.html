                <h2>Jørgen Jensen</h2>
                <p> Jørgen Jensen (1891–1922) was a Danish-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at that time. Jensen enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in March 1915, serving with the 10th Battalion during the latter stages of the Gallipoli Campaign. After the Australian force withdrew to Egypt, he was transferred to the newly formed 50th Battalion, and sailed for France with the unit in June 1916. On the Western Front, he was wounded during the battalion's first serious action, the Battle of Mouquet Farm in August, and only returned to his unit in late January 1917. On 2 April, his battalion attacked the Hindenburg Outpost Line at Noreuil, where his actions led to the capture of over fifty German soldiers and resulted in the award of the Victoria Cross. Jensen survived the war, despite a severe head wound in April 1918, but died in 1922.</p>
